Coding exercises in Python for solving Advent of Code 2021 problems

This was my first attempts at Python coding.

My company set up an unofficial group for whoever was interested in working on the Advent of Code, recognizing it would be a valuable learning experience. Coworkers and I decided to do it in Python since we hadn't worked much in it. I made it through day 15 of 25.
