Coding exercises in Python for solving Advent of Code 2021 problems

Website of problems: https://adventofcode.com/2021

This was my first project in Python coding.

My company set up an unofficial group for whoever was interested in working on the Advent of Code, recognizing it would be a valuable learning experience. Coworkers and I decided to do it in Python to learn the language. I made it through day 15 of 25.

Everything is written as functions in one file, aoc.py, without much refinement or refactoring, because there was a time component to the solutions so speed was a factor. The functions are descriptively-named, so you can match them up with the days from the website.

Input data is all stored in input_data in .txt files.
